## Description
NFE is a tool that allows anyone to edit their anime pictures using Deep Learning to change attributes such as hair colour, hair length, eye colour etc.

The project is mainly inspired by works on interpreting the latent space of GANs for people face generation [1] and other methods of manipulating GAN output [2]. 
It leverages techniques mentioned in the papers to edit real usersâ€™ photos, change multiple image features, and preserve the general image content. 
These features for editing would probably include hair colour, eye colour, etc., which are not explored in the previous works.

## Project Architecture
![Step 1 and 2](images/image_generation_annotation.jpg)
![Step 3](images/svm.jpg)
Mainly adopted from Shen et al. [1], our project architecture consists of several models.

Stage 1 is image generation. StyleGAN is used to produce images of anime faces.

Stage 2 is generated image annotation. We use [illustration2Vec](https://github.com/rezoo/illustration2vec) proposed by Saito and Matsui [2] to tag images with tags we need.

Stage 3 is image classification. For the each attribute we want to be able to control further, we train a SVM for separating latent codes based on some feature. This would let us know the vector in which this feature changes in the latent space.

### Image Manipulation


### GAN Inversion
Some preliminary results to access quality of GAN inversion:

### Telegram Bot
We also created telegram bot for our project, which is currently hosted on local computer and thus is not available 24/7. Alias: [@neural_face_editor_bot](https://t.me/neural_face_editor_bot)

This bot is intended to download anime faces photos from the users (or generate random ones) and allow to change some image attributes in the convenient telegram interface.

At this step, telegram bot uses trained StyleGAN to generate random anime faces. Intro message is available by `/help`*.* Send `/face` to try generating random images! (when bot would be online...)

Here are some examples of bot interaction:
